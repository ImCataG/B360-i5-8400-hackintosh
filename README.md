# B360-i5-8400-hackintosh
EFI for running MacOS Ventura 13.2.1 on my PC.
Uses OpenCore 0.9.0.
I followed the [Dortania Guide](https://dortania.github.io/getting-started/).

# SPECS

The PC this runs on is a LENOVO prebuilt.

- i5 8400
- Lenovo B360 motherboard with a single HDMI output (config has patches for multiple outputs though)
- UHD 630 iGPU
- GTX 1060 (Disabled, should in theory use '-wegnoegpu' boot argument to disable, but apparently not needed)
- 2x8GB HyperX Fury 2400MHz
- RTL8111 for networking
- the PC is always connected through Ethernet, so no Wireless drivers/kexts

# What you need to change for this to work
- in config.plist -> PlatformInfo -> Generic, use GenSMBIOS to generate MLB, ROM, SerialNumber and UUID

# iServices and Apple ID

- Call switching to iPhone works
- Copy and Pasting between devices does not work
- Connecting my Apple ID probably works because I own multiple Apple devices

# Future Plans

- Maybe add Bluetooth and Wi-Fi support to see if AirPods can quick switch

# Random Facts and Tools that can be helpful

- I did not use my Ethernet MAC address to generate the ROM, I instead used one generated by [GenSMBIOS](https://github.com/corpnewt/GenSMBIOS) and made sure it had Apple's numbers, which you can check using the [Wireshark List](https://gitlab.com/wireshark/wireshark/-/raw/master/manuf)
- I used this [Sanity Checker](https://sanitychecker.ocutils.me/) to make sure my config.plist was correct
- I used [ProperTree](https://github.com/corpnewt/ProperTree) to easily edit my config.plist
